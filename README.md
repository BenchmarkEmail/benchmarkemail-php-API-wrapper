## Description
* All of our example XML-RPC code from the documentation for use with PEAR XML-RPC2. (Recommended)
* This is recommended and is the most efficient and fastest way to use our api.
* It will always be updated, you can use any method the moment the api is added.
* It requires that you be able to setup Pear XML-RPC2 by yourself. https://pear.php.net/package/XML_RPC2/
* BME API For PHP 4/5 - connects to and supports the methods found in version 1.3 of our API.
* This is a slower way and is deprecated currently.
* We donâ€™t usually update the methods, so updates will be infrequent

## Prerequisites
